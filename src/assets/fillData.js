        description: "We're going to skip all single/double stroke fills and get right into this one. This is the first pattern that really leveled up my playing. It is very simple in principle, but you'll notice that as you start to increase the tempo, it becomes much harder to coordinate your limbs. Once you feel comfortable, experiment with playing the 'RL' hand part on other drums/surfaces and play the pattern for longer phrases."

        description: "This is yet another pattern that is still pretty simple to start with, but as you increase the tempo it will become harder to control. Really focus on making the accents loud and the grace notes (ghost notes) as soft as possible. Once it feels comfortable, move the right-hand accents to different drums/surfaces and play the pattern for longer phrases."

        description: "This is a great/quick fill to add to the end of a musical phrase. Depending on the tempo, or if you have a double bass drum pedal, it can be easy or more challenging. I think the most important thing here is to play it as loud as possible, but also try to make sure the triplet notes are evenly spaced."

        description: "This is a pretty basic application of the six stroke roll rudiment with some single strokes added to the end. Really focus on making the accents loud and the grace notes (ghost notes) as soft as possible, as well as soft, evenly-spaced double strokes for the ghost notes. Once you feel comfortable with it, move the accents to different drums/surfaces."

        description: "Depending on if you have a double bass pedal or not, you can really push the tempo on this one. If not, then it is a great workout for double strokes on your right foot. The presence or absence of a double pedal will ultimately determine the difficulty, but it is a gateway into experimenting with other 'fraction fills'. Once you feel comfortable, experiment with playing the 'RLRL' hand part on other drums/surfaces and play the pattern for longer phrases."

        difficulty: "Very Hard",
        description: "This is honestly just something I came up with to combine some of the previous fills into one. It contains RllK followed by 2 RLKs that morph into a left-handed six stroke roll, but the last note is replaced by a 'K', and finally finishes off with a 4/2 fraction fill. The biggest take-away from this is that everything in drumming is a pattern and you can mash up and combine patterns together to make something really cool (or sometimes not very cool, you just have to experient)!"
